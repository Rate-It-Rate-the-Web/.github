# RateIt! Rate the Web.

## Description:
### Rate every Website (and every URL) you find. View the ratings and view them directly injected to the Website in some Websites, like Youtube or Google.

## Roadplan
- [ ] Adding Comments (Discussions) - adding reporting function
- [ ] Adding Google Search direct view on rating of a Website
- [ ] Adding Youtube direct view of discussion if comments of a video are disabled
- [ ] Adding Youtube direct buttons to rate a Youtube Channel
- [ ] Adding a Citing function for parts of the Website in the discussion
- [ ] Adding a RateIt "Homepage" that just works like every other Social Media but a bit different, most-liked Websites (today) are shown and so own
- [ ] Adding User Profiles and Settings
